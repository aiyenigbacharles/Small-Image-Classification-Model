# Small Image Classification Model

This repository contains a compact deep learning image classification model trained and evaluated on the widely used CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates a complete workflow for training, validating, and testing a neural network on small color images categorized into 10 different classes.

---

## Features

- **Dataset:** Uses CIFAR-10, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **Model:** Implements a neural network (likely CNN) for image classification.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Notebook covers data preparation, model training, visualization, and testing.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive and well-commented for learning and easy experimentation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Common scientific libraries: numpy, matplotlib, etc.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aiyenigbacharles/Small-Image-Classification-Model.git
   cd Small-Image-Classification-Model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - If a `requirements.txt` is available:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Otherwise, install common dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Launch the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in your browser.

---

## Usage

- Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
- The notebook will download the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, train, and evaluate it.
- You can edit model parameters, architectures, or add more experiments as you wish.

## Model Overview

- **Input:** 32x32 color images
- **Output:** One of 10 CIFAR-10 classes
- **Possible Layers:** Convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling, dense layers, dropout, etc.
- **Loss & Metrics:** Categorical crossentropy, accuracy, etc.

## Customization

- To use a different dataset, modify the data loading and preprocessing section.
- To experiment with architectures, edit the model definition cell.
- Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs) can easily be changed in code.
